<h1>Ticket Resolutions: Adobe Upgrade Ticket ðŸªŸ</h1>
This section outlines a hypothetical scenario in which our End-User Karen Doe has submitted a ticket where the Adobe Software in the Accounting Department has stopped working. I have structured this section so we can see the Ticket Thread as a series of events which include changing the properties of the Ticket in the beginning to the conversation thread with the End-User to the solution of the ticket.

1. Below I have created a ticket as our End-User Karen Doe. The main features of the ticket we can observe before changing a couple of features are the priority level which is normal, it is assigned to the suppport department, it is currently unassigned any agents and has a default SLA Plan of 18 hours. The End-User Karen has stated "adobe software not working for employees in the accounting department."

2. Next we can see the end stage of this ticket from the perspective of the End-User Karen within the Support Center User Panel. At the top, the SLA Plan has been changed to Sev B which has a grace period of 4 hours. The ticket has been assigned to John Doe who is now a Level 1 Support Agent.

In the conversation thread we can see the initial reply from our Agent John Doe stating that the software required a remote update from his side. The update was then actioned by the Agent and then the End-User was prompted to confirm if the software was now working in the accounting department. The End-User then replied confirming that the software was now up and running. The Agent then replied to acknowledge the result and then closed the ticket.
